## Introduction 

This is the presentation of the final project of Data Product Course. 
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. 

-First, I created a Shiny application and deployed it on Rstudio's servers. 

-Second, I prepared this presentation about my application.

## Shiny Application

The name of the application is "Wage linear regression analysis and prediction".

This app uses the dataset Wage to show the linear regression of Wage. You can chose 
the predictor among Year, age, Education and race.

Moreover, you can predict the wage ($) of a person by entering the year, age, education and race.


## Instructions to run it 

You can download the shiny application for this repository and run it from you R-Studio or you can
access through the shinyapp server using https://mcastrol.shinyapps.io/finalassigment/.

You choose the type of predictor among the options: Year, Age, Education and Race, and the app shows you a plot with the regression line.

If you input a year, age, education level and race, you can obtyain the raw wage in dolars of a person, 
calculated using a regresion linear model of the wage respect of year, ager, education and race.

## Final

Thanks for your attention!
